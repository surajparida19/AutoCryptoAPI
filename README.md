Automatic Crypto Data Fetching using Python 🚀

This project automatically pulls cryptocurrency data from the CoinMarketCap API using Python and stores it in a structured format. It helps track real-time prices, market trends, and historical changes, making it useful for traders, analysts, and developers.

🔹 Features:
✅ Fetches real-time crypto data using CoinMarketCap API
✅ Stores data in a CSV file for future analysis
✅ Runs at scheduled intervals using a loop and time.sleep()
✅ Uses pandas for data processing and matplotlib/seaborn for visualization
✅ Can be extended for crypto price analysis, trend detection, or trading strategies

🔹 Tech Stack:
🐍 Python
🛠️ requests (API handling)
📊 pandas (Data processing)
📈 matplotlib & seaborn (Data visualization)
🔹 How It Works:
1️⃣ Connects to CoinMarketCap API and retrieves crypto data
2️⃣ Processes and normalizes the data using pandas
3️⃣ Appends the data to crypto_data.csv (avoiding duplicates)
4️⃣ Runs in a loop to fetch new data at regular intervals
5️⃣ (Optional) Visualizes price trends using matplotlib

🔹 Future Enhancements:
🔸 Automate data fetching with a scheduler (cron job)
🔸 Store data in a database (MySQL/PostgreSQL) instead of CSV
🔸 Create a dashboard with Flask/Django & React
🔸 Integrate AI models for crypto trend predictions

🔹 Why Use This Project?
💰 Ideal for crypto traders to track real-time prices
📊 Useful for researchers analyzing crypto market trends
⚡ Great starting point for automated trading bots
